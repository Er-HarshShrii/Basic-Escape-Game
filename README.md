RPG based Simple Escape Game 
The gameâ€™s story is about being Lost on a puzzled room with no resources. Will you Survive or Die?

Hi! Iâ€™m new here (actually I started my adventure with game development few days ago ðŸ˜‰ ). 
Thank you for playing my first game (well, version 0.0.1 Alpha)! I will be grateful for any support and advice. 
Before starting the game, I chose Basic Web view for the game due to minimilistic approach & it offers great possibilities for the future. 
But since Iâ€™m just learning it, I apologize for any optimization problems. Have a nice game!
